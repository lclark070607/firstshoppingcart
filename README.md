creating a simple shopping cart

Issues/Notes:
1.  I spent a lot of time on the visual aspect of this site.  Safest aspect I suppose.  
In another file(yogastorefront-I'll provide link), I set up SASS and Foundation.  I got lost
in the possiblities of Foundation.  I really want to dig deep into that!!!  So I watched
a tutorial on introduction to the grid here:

http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/introduction-to-the-foundation-grid.html
http://foundation.zurb.com/forum/posts/24690-new-article-5-ways-to-use-zurb-foundation

I found a great series on building a site up with Zurb:

I got really excited by Emmet, however I realized after conversation with you
that the end result was really bloated html.  I did appreciate how it layed out the 
grid and I could see using it as a reference if I feel lost.

2.  I really wanted to dig into building out a top-bar for my store with a drop down menu
just because.  I found a lot of tutorials to follow including:
http://zurb.com/building-blocks/f6-top-bar
http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/components/topbar.html#clickable

I'm still not entirely clear on whether the stuff I find in the tutorial for Foundation 5
is still relevant for Foundation 6?  So I started to get a little lost in the differences
and decided to focus on the Javascript.  I realized there are a lot of really useful elements
and attributes when building out the bar:  data-options, data-top-bar-role, contain-to-grid,
$top-bar-sticky(scss)....

I also realized that I needed to upload the js file for top-bar...I got really frustrated
building out toggle menus and they didn't work!  Duh...realized I was missing this:
    <script src="js/foundation/foundation.js"></script>
    <script src="js/foundation/foundation.topbar.js"></script>

3. I need work with good old vanilla JavaScript.  I found this AWESOME tutorial about setting
up a shopping cart.  It was so great to go through the work flow.  This person really
paid a lot of attention to best practices, how to console.log effectively, and testing.
I really loved this....Took me most of my day Sunday to work through the first half.  and
the shopping cart functions are all Javascript.  

I decided to teach myself JQuery.  I know that there is a purpose to your approach but
I couldn't find help.  The anxiety of not being able to access the right info is frustrating
and I know I need better skills at using plain vanilla JavaScript.  I reread the textbook
and watched this tutorial:

But rather than continue with a blank screen I decided to follow some tutorials and teach it to myself since a lot of tutorials
online seem to use it.  

I followed these tutorials on how to install & to learn some of the syntax.  I couldn't figure
out how to make the CDN link work.  I think I was conflicting with what may have already beeon
established with my Foundation upload?  I spent some time trying to play with script placement
and finally decided to find a tutorial.  I saw that there may have been some steps to serve
up the local version of JQuery?  I followed the upload file method.  
I'm sure this causes bloat.  I'll ask you about it later.  I used this for install and syntax:
